korean Out of the flying pan into the fire
I have been to view the flower. There were a lot of people there.
I feel tried no matter what I do
I will be with you no matter what you do
Over my dead body
I'm just hoping nothing goes wrong
The bus has just gone
It's icing on the cake
I think she's out of your league
This is out of your league
I've got my hands full till late in the afternoon
I wanted to kick myself
I got to come
Don't you have a spare key ?
Why do you get to do it all the time ?
I mean it
When was the last time we ate ?
How are you getting on ?
I enjoyed the meal (It was delicious)
I'm calling about the lenz for sale
I need to think it over
You got me
I was badly taken
I (have) never thought I would see you here
I didn't mean to do that
You're barking up the wrong tree
How did you like Japan ?
What is it like living in New York ?
It look like snowing
Like that's ever gonna happen
I could eat a horse
That explains it
The movie hit the jackpot
It's a real eyesor (What an eyesore !)
You think you've been in my shoes
I never mix the business with pleasure
I would rather not say
Don't judge a book by its cover
Sure enough, the bus was so late
I feel as though something serious is going to happen
I have trouble keeping up with this class
I have my watch stolen
We had two bottles left
Don't even think about it

No way !
What's your idea ?
I've always wanted to learn how to fish
How many languages do you speak ?
How many of us are there ?
They're an item
He is supposed to be here
What are you up to tonight ?
Two seconds
Seize the day
I just wanted to tell you
I just wanted you to tell me somthing
Today is windy and cold
I'll try to enunicate better and slower for you
Are you getting ready for work ?
I'll show you how to make the report
I wonder what he will say
I'm not really an outdoor person
How could you be so careless ?
I think I have good chance
Stop hitting on her
Stop worring = Take it easy

I was going to call you but I forgot.
How can you say that to me ?

Not much. I sat around and watched a movie
Would you like to get a moive ?
I'd like you to clean up your room now
You haven't so much as looked at me in a week
Apparently, other people have made the same mistake.
That's news to me
It's no big deal (= That's nothing)
What's big deal ?
I'm a rotten shopper
I can't go his nagging (= I can't stand his nagging)
It's not working
It's hard to tell.
The toilet is clogged. Where's the plunger ?
Flattery will get you nowhere !
Flattery is foreign to my nature
Never be without great coffee
Time passes much too quickly
English is number one on my list of objectives
The sun is high in the sky
I work out to lose weight these days
I couldn't attend the meeting because of a previous appointment
I could finish this report thanks to you
I'm so tired that I need to take a rest
I couldn't sleep a wink last night
I'll take your smile to mean yes
I have to get my work finished by everning
I'll get you water at once
Too much wine makes men drunk
I'll see to it
He tried several times to get sober, but kept falling off the wagon
Buy one get one free
I'm just about to cross my mind
I'm just about to throw in a towel

Truth be known
You do this everytime they come
It rains everytime I wash my car
She talks about money everytime she meets me
You are busy everytime I call you
I'm in the middle of calling ( = I'm on the phone)
I just tossed and turned all night
I want you to read this book.
I'm in my mid (early, later) thirties
I'm in my thirties
Heads up !
Do as you wish
I just wanted to listen to you
When are you going to start acting like a human being?
We have an elephant in the room but I don’t think we should talk about it.
The truth may hurt but silence hurts much more.
Don't waste your breath
He is such a bad egg
Do you want me to tell the truth ?
Why am I doing this ?
I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be a issue
I'm sure that you fit in with the company
Guess what
You don't say (= Don't tell me)
